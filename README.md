# LogScale GCP
LogScale GCP provides a reference implementation for provisioning infrastructure using Terraform to run LogScale on GCP. In order to complete the installation the [LogScale GCP Components](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/logscale-gcp-components) must also be deployed. Deploying this project will incur costs on GCP the amount of which will vary based on the LogScale cluster size chosen during deploy.



LogScale GCP is an open source project and not a CrowdStrike product. As such, it carries no formal support, expressed, or implied.
